# Web Accessibility Project

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to improve the accessibility of a marketing agency's website. The primary goal is to follow accessibility standards, making the website optimized for search engines and providing an inclusive experience for all users. We'll be enhancing the codebase, ensuring it meets these standards while also cleaning and organizing the code for long-term sustainability.

### The Scout Rule

An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it. To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Challenge Requirements

### User Story

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Semantic HTML Elements**: When I view the source code, I should find semantic HTML elements.
- **Logical Structure**: When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I should find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- **Accessible Alt Attributes**: When I view the image elements, I should find accessible alt attributes.
- **Sequential Headings**: When I view the heading attributes, they should fall in sequential order.
- **Concise Title**: When I view the title element, I should find a concise, descriptive title.
